first of all, comix is gone. it's not in official repository.
but i haven't used it recently, so leave it gone.

`gsettings list-keys org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings | sort`
`gsettings range org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-side-e`

alt-tap cycles through ALL windows (even in another workspace)
to cycle through windows in current workspace, use ALT-ESC
you can override with
`gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings cycle-windows "['<Alt>Tab']"`

you can do gsessings with gconf-editor in GUI..

wow. I found it. it's not in gconf though...
